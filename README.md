## Question: Does sea ice extent have a relationship with nutrient avialibility and chlorophyll-a concentrations in Western Alaska coastal waters?

## Data: 
### Sea ice data: ### https://polarwatch.noaa.gov/erddap/files/nsidcCDRiceSQsh1day/2017/seaice_conc_daily_sh_f17_20170807_v03r01.nc 
### Chlorophyll-a Data: https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/nesdisVHNnoaaSNPPnoaa20chlaGapfilledDaily.html
### Nutrient Data: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/world-ocean-database/bin/getgeodata.pl?Depth=O&WorldOcean.x=392&WorldOcean.y=96


## Description:
### Here, I will analyze the relationship between sea ice extent on algal blooms. This will be done using sea ice cover data compared to chl-a data as a proxy for phytoplankton abundance, and nutrient data to understand how the bloom is fueled. The figures produced from this analysis will allow for a better understanding of how reduced sea ice cover under climate change may be effecting the timing of algal blooms and a release of nutrients.  


## Figures: 
### 1. Sea ice cover over time
### 2. Nutrient plot as scatter (color dots by concentration)
### 3. Chl-a concentration as pcolormesh 
### 4. Visualize the location using cartopy looking at chl-a and sea ice data 
### 5. Anomaly chl-a, nutrients, and sea ice
