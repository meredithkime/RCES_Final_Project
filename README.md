## Question: Do sea ice concentrations have a relationship with chlorophyll-a concentrations in Western Alaska coastal waters?

## Data: 
### Sea-Ice Data: https://polarwatch.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/nsidcCDRice_nh_grid.html
### Sea-Ice Lat/Lon Data: https://polarwatch.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/nsidcCDRice_nh_grid.html
### Chlorophyll-a Data: https://polarwatch.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/erdMH1chla1day.html

## Description:
### Here, I will analyze the relationship between sea ice extent on algal blooms. This will be done using sea ice cover data compared to chl-a data as a proxy for phytoplankton abundance. The figures produced from this analysis will allow for a better understanding of how reduced sea ice cover under climate change may be effecting the timing of algal blooms and a release of nutrients.  


## Figures: 
### 1. Mean chlorophyll-a and sea ice concentrations
### 2. Mean timeseries comparison over 5 years
### 3. Max chl-a and min sea-ice concentrations
### 4. Annual mean chlorophyll-a and sea ice concentration timeseries
### 5. Summer mean chlorophyll-a and sea ice concentration timeseries
### 6. Annual and seasonal anomaly calculations
### 7. Data visualization in Kotzebue Sound
### 8. Anomaly correlations in Kotzebue Sound
